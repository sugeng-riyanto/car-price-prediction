This is a simple Flask web application for predicting car prices using a trained machine learning model. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Flask Setup:**
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request
    import joblib

    app = Flask(__name__)
    ```
   - The Flask framework is imported, and an instance of the Flask class is created.

2. **Load Trained Model:**
    ```python
    # Load the trained model
    model = joblib.load('car_price_prediction_model.pkl')
    ```
   - The `joblib` library is used to load a pre-trained machine learning model stored in the file 'car_price_prediction_model.pkl'.

3. **Define Routes:**
    ```python
    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return render_template('index.html')

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        # Function to handle prediction
    ```
   - Two routes are defined: 
     - `'/'` - This is the home page where the user can input data.
     - `'/predict'` - This route is triggered when the user submits a form with input data.

4. **Handle Input and Make Prediction:**
    ```python
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Get input values from the form
        input_features = [float(x) for x in request.form.values()]
        # Make prediction using the loaded model
        predicted_price = model.predict([input_features])
        return render_template('index.html', prediction_text=f'Predicted Car Price: ${predicted_price[0]:.2f}')
    ```
   - If the request method is POST (i.e., form submission), it retrieves the input values from the form, converts them to a list of floats, and then uses the loaded model to make a prediction.
   - The predicted car price is displayed on the home page.

5. **Run the Application:**
    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
   - The application is run in debug mode if the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).

6. **HTML Templates:**
   - The `render_template` function is used to render HTML templates. The main template is 'index.html', which likely includes a form for input and space to display the predicted car price.
